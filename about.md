Eggs & Pool is a fun, family-friendly game played on or after easter, where
colored eggs from the holiday are used as pool balls.

### History
E&P began as a children's game in the 1600s in a small town in Whales. Back then
eggs were the only thing round enough to legitimately play a cue sport with,
and E&P was the de-facto way to play pool. However, in 1627, some hack Englishman
figured out how to use a crude version of sand-paper to whittle down elephant ivory
until it was smooth enough to play with, and suddenly pool tables got a lot cleaner
and a lot less interesting. :(

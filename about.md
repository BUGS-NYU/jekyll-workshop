BUGS is a member of the Mozilla-led Open Source Student Network (OSSN), a network of university students and clubs who share the belief that open source software – technology built with code that is open for view, use, and modification – is the engine that powers innovation. Mozilla's goal is to support, empower and help Clubs and their members towards getting more skills and contributing to Open Source Projects through this network of Clubs.

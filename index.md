Eggs & Pool is a fun, family-friendly game played on or after easter, where
colored eggs from the holiday are used as pool balls. Funnily enough, it used to
just be called "pool," until the English figured out how to make spheres out of
glass.

## Upcoming Events

##### Nov. 8, 2018
### BUGS Varsity Tryouts
The All-U games are coming up, with E & P taking center stage, and that means we
need the best team we can get to show the noobs at ACM and Tandon what E & P is
all about! Tryouts will happen from 4-7pm in Weinstein SB20 (the subcellar classroom).
We will have both hard-boiled and raw egg tryouts, so please bring a change of clothes.

##### Feb. 2, 2019
### Eggs & Pool Social
Have you ever tried playing pool with eggs? Join BUGS on February 19 to get your
chance! Our Eggs & Pool social will involve plenty of eggs, and machine-washable
pool tables! Come to Courant Room 517 at 5:30pm and see for yourself
how great eggs & pool can be! (free omelettes will be served after round 1.)

# If you'd like to use Ruby a lot, then you should use 'rbenv' or 'rvm'
# This solution is a quick and dirty few lines you can add to your .bashrc

# (bc `sudo` is bad)

# Used https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2619695/gem-install-permission-problem
export GEM_HOME=~/.gem
export GEM_PATH="$GEM_HOME"

# Add the jekyll command line tool to your path
export PATH="$GEM_HOME/bin:$PATH"

# Jekyll 3.8.4 is the latest version that works with my RubyGems file
# Yours might be different
gem install jekyll:3.8.4 bundle

**Grading:** There will be a combination of programming assignments and problem sets. There will also be a midterm exam and a final exam. Final grades will be weighted as follows:

*   programming assignments: 20%
*   problem sets: 30%
*   midterm exam: 20%
*   final exam: 30%

**Topics:**

*   Recurrence equations and divide & conquer
*   Sorting and Searching
*   Probabilistic algorithms
*   Hashing
*   Balanced trees
*   Graph algorithms (DFS, path problems, MST; using reductions for algorithm design)
*   Dynamic programming
*   Greedy algorithms
*   Amortized analysis

**Text:**

*   _Introduction to Algorithms (Third Edition)_, by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein.

**Other stuff:**

*   [Code: sorting.cpp](https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring19/CSCI-UA.0310-005/sorting.cpp)

**Problem Sets:**

*   These will be handed out in class.

**Programming Assignments:**

1.  [Programming Assignment 1 **(due Feb 10, 11:45pm)**](https://www.hackerrank.com/basic-algorithms-spring-2019-pa1)
    *   For this assignment, you should use the following [Java starter code](https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring19/CSCI-UA.0310-005/twothree-starter.java)
    *   You can use Python instead of Java for this assignment. Here is the [Python starter code](https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring19/CSCI-UA.0310-005/twothree-starter.py)
    *   In Java, you should also use a _BufferedWriter_ object for your output. See [details here](https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring19/CSCI-UA.0310-005/UseBufferedWriter.java)
    *   Additional sample I/O is [available here](https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring19/CSCI-UA.0310-005/2-3-tree-range-query-sample-io.zip)
2.  Programming Assignment 2 **(due Feb 24, 11:45pm)**
    *   You must use 2-3 trees for this assigment, using the data structures discussed in recitation
    *   Additional sample I/O is [available here](https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring19/CSCI-UA.0310-005/2-3-tree-range-update-sample-io.zip)
    *   **NOTE: this programming assignment is OBSOLETE. You must do Programming Assignment 2a (below) instead.**
3.  [Programming Assignment 2a **(due Feb 24, 11:45pm)**](https://www.hackerrank.com/basic-algorithms-spring-2019-pa2a)

    *   You must use 2-3 trees for this assigment, using the data structures discussed in recitation
    *   Additional sample I/O is [available here](https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring19/CSCI-UA.0310-005/2-3-tree-range-update-sample-io.zip)
